      Hi, my name is Joshua!
    </h1>
    👋 I have a first class degree in Computer Science, specialising in Java.
    <br>
    👀 I’m looking to restart my Java programming career after years working in other fields.
    <br>
    🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Spring, web/microservice development with REST/SOAP, having recently completed a Spring Master Class online course. I'm new to GitHub/Git and getting up to speed!
